NOTE: This directory contains several different deep-learning models for TC formation detection
      from a given binary reanalysis dataset, which are centered on TC locations from the best
      track data. This input data must be created in advance, but it can be included as a part 
      of the system here under the utils location.

DIR STRCUTURE:
1. CNN-sequential: a simple CNN sequential model that is built from scratch, with only a few
      convolutionl layers. This model will output a bunch of save-best models that are varying
      with different number of dense layers, filters, and kernel sizes.

2. CNN-functional: a more tuned CNN functionla model that has some additional options for
      the accuracy metric. Similar to CNN-sequential model, this model also has a range of
      model save-best outputs with different number of dense layers, filters, and kernel
      sizes. There are two versions for this architecture, one is using the binary_accuracy
      and the other use the F1-score as a metric   

3. ResNet: This dir contains a deep ResNet model with 50 convolutional layers, using the same
      identity block/convolutional block as in Andrew Ng's lectures. It will output however
      a single save-best model.
