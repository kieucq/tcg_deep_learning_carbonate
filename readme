NOTE: This directory contains several different deep-learning models for TC formation detection
      from a given binary reanalysis dataset, which are centered on TC locations from the best
      track data. This input data must be created in advance, which can be generated by using 
      e.g., the script under the utils location.

DIR STRCUTURE:
1. CNN-sequential: a simple CNN sequential model that is built from scratch, with only a few
      convolutionl layers. This model will output a bunch of save-best models that are varying
      with different number of dense layers, filters, and kernel sizes.

2. CNN-functional: a more tuned CNN functionla model that has some additional options for
      the accuracy metric. Similar to CNN-sequential model, this model also has a range of
      model save-best outputs with different number of dense layers, filters, and kernel
      sizes. There are two versions for this architecture, one is using the binary_accuracy
      and the other use the F1-score as a metric   

3. ResNet: This dir contains a deep ResNet model with 50 convolutional layers, using the same
      identity block/convolutional block as in Andrew Ng's lectures. It will output however
      a single save-best model.

4. utils: This dir contains all utilities that can be used to extract NCEP/WRF output to a
      binary input data structure for ML training processes. This step must be done first
      if moving to a new system. These utilities are copied from Quan Nguyen's research.
