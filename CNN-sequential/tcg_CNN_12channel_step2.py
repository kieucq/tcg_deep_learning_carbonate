#
# NOTE: This machine learning program is for predicting TC formation, using
#       input dataset in the NETCDF format. The program treats different
#       2D input fields as different channels of an image. This specific
#       program requires a set of 12 2D-variables (12-channel image) and
#       consists of three stages
#       - Stage 1: reading NETCDF input and generating (X,y) data with a
#                  given image sizes, which are then saved by pickle;
#       - Stage 2: import the saved pickle (X,y) pair and build a CNN model
#                  with a given training/validation ratio, and then save
#                  the train model under tcg_CNN.model.
#       - Stage 3: import the trained model from Stage 2, and make a list
#                  of prediction from normalized test data.
#
# INPUT: This Stage 2 script requires two specific input datasets that are
#        generated from Step 1, including
#        1. tcg_X.pickle: data contains all images of yes/no TCG events, each
#           of these images must have 12 channels
#        2. tcg_y.pickle: data contains all labels of each image (i.e., yes
#           or no) of TCG corresponding to each data in X.
#
#        Remarks: Note that each channel must be normalized separealy. Also
#        the script requires a large memory allocation. So users need to have
#        GPU version to run this.
#
# OUTPUT: A CNN model built from Keras saved under tcg_CNN.model

# HIST: - 27, Oct 22: Created by CK
#       - 01, Nov 22: Modified to include more channels
